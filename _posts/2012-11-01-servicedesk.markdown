After surveying the woeful options available for an ITIL service desk/NOC, a colleague and I wrote our own, a .NET web application. It was designed around the actual challenges faced by service desks, and featured:
- Very fast navigation and immediate information, with useful live data on incident queues and volumes
- Visibility and alerting on SLAs for initial and ongoing customer contact
- Automated ticket allocation
- Integration with Microsoft Lync for inbound phone enquiries (route customer directly to current assignee)
