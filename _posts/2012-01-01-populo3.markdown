Came to the realisation that Populo had become an overengineered mess. In designing the ultimate features, it was so complex I could not even use it anymore. Learned a tough and valuable lessing in [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

Stripped out a great many unneccessary features in an effort to make the site usable, and did a design overhaul.
