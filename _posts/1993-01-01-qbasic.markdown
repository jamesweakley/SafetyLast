Wrote my first game mod, which involved me editing the source code of QBASIC Gorillas to make the explosions larger. I then decided to write my own maze exploration game. From memory I took a rather crude approach and just used a huge collection of IF statements on the player coordinates to allow or prevent movement and detect the end.
