Expanded my telephony repertoire, this time for inbound calls: 
- Wrote a script for a customer with an expensive and timed ISDN connection who needed occasional after-hours VPN access. Received an inbound phonecall and connected back out to the internet for a time specified by DTMF tones.
- Gaffer-taped an array of analog modems to a desktop PC and set up an direct-dial service for remote workers.
