Completed a R course that covered data sanitisation and some basic machine learning/statistical analysis. It was nice to get back to some functional programming again, (the vectorised functions make for some nice terse code), but I had similar frustrations to those I had with Python - that the community produces very useful but awfully designed libraries.
