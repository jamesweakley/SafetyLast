### APC Driver, Australian Army Reserve
Joined for part-time work while studying at university, and to try something a bit different. Operated and maintained the [M113A1 Armoured Fighting Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M113_armored_personnel_carrier). Got yelled at and fired/detonated/drove countless different weapons. Won a marksmanship award.
