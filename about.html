## About

I have been fascinated with technology and its applications for as long as I can remember. I have worked in a variety of different areas including systems integration, network operations, and software design / development / delivery.

I enjoy working with people and always aim to surround myself with people I can learn from.

My hobbies vary from year to year, but aside from spending time with my family, generally revolve around: learning new software architectures, machine learning, data mining, augmented/virtual reality, gaming and games development, music and composition, science fiction, philosophy, eating and cooking, keeping fit to offset the eating, and getting cautiously excited about a space colony.
